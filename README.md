The **Data Joy Specification (DJS)** defines how to describe a tabular data asset using a JSON or YAML document. DJS is released under [Apache 2.0 license](./LICENSE). Contributions from the data community are welcomed!

This GitHub project is the starting point for DJS. Here you will find the information you need about the DJS, simple examples of what it looks like, and some general information regarding the project.

## Status
The current version of the DJS is [DJS v1.0.0](./versions/1.0.0.md).

### Previous versions
This repository also contains all [previous versions](./versions).

Each folder in this repository, such as examples and schemas, contains folders about the current and previous versions of the specification.
