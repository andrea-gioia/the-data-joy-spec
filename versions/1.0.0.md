#### Disclaimer

Part of this content has been taken from the great work done by the folks at the <a href="https://openapis.org" target="_blank">OpenAPI Initiative</a> and <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/" target="_blank">AsyncAPI Initiative</a>. We have decided to not reinvent the wheel and inspire our work to these two specifications mainly for the following reasons:

- We think that the work made by OpenAPI Initiative and AsyncAPI Initiative is great :)
- We want to make the learning curve for the Data Product Descriptor Specification as smooth as possible, aligning its definition to the one of other two popular specifications in the software and data engineers community
- We think that OpenAPI and AsyncAPI are natural specifications for defining the interface of data product's ports that expose an API endpoint. This specification does not impose the use of any specific standard for the port's interface definition but these two are highly recommended.


## Introduction

The Data Product Descriptor Specification (DPDS) defines a declarative and technology-independent standard to describe a data product in all its components. It allows human agents (e.g. analysts, data scientists, etc..) and digital agents (e.g. other data products, BI tools, planes of the underlying data mesh ops platform, etc..) to operate, discover and access a data product. When properly defined, an external agent can understand and interact with the data product with a minimal amount of cognitive load and implementation logic.

The formalization of a standard data product descriptor document through an open specification is useful to enable the implementation of an ecosystem of interoperable data mesh tools. The following is a non-exhaustive list of tools that can benefit from the specification:

- catalogs (search, document, and collaborate) 
- design tools (create new products by the composition of reusable templates)
- lifecycle management tools (deploy and operate) 
- access management tools (assign/track access grants and generate client code in different languages)
- policies checking tools (enforce standard compliance and audit security)
- observability tools (monitor and detect)
- data lineage tools (trace data flows and perform forward/backward analysis)
- mesh topology analysis tools (calculate value/trust scores and detect structural problems)
- semantic tools (apply ontologies over mesh topology)
- domain-specific language tools (create a collection of interconnected data products that implement together a specific value stream)
